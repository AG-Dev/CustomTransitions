# CustomTransitions

This project contains the examples that go along with the Objective Toast article titled [Custom Transitions on iOS]().

## Setup

After cloning the repo, `pod install` to set everything up with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

## Notes

When you run the app, you will first see a menu with a list of the examples. After you run each example, you can return to the main menu by tapping anywhere in the example view (the one with the colorful background).
